									<p>
										Well done for taking some time to get to know yourself a
										little better. Hopefully you have a bit more of a grasp on
										what your own unique mental health needs are, and what
										tweaks you can make to reduce your stress.
									</p>
									<p>
										Your colour wheel identifies which areas you might want to
										focus on, with red being areas of priority. The conversation
										highlighted that you feel well matched in some areas but
										perhaps others need some focus.
									</p>
									<p>
										You have identified some great strengths and being aware of
										what your senses need is one of them. You acknowledge that
										you are in a tricky situation with the demands of your job,
										but with some tweaks and extra support this will feel more
										manageable.
									</p>
									<p>You identified 3 areas of focus:</p>
									<p>
										1. Speak with your boss around time management. Request to
										block out protected admin time first thing to reduce
										overwhelm.
										<br />
										2. Priorisite swimming 3 times per week.
										<br />
										3. Build professional community network to reduce isolation.
